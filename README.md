# FirefoxConfig
This is the `userChrome.css` file I use for Firefox

This is designed around the wonderful (Tree Style Tab)[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/] extension.  

It would not have been possible without much googling, and the help of the friendly people at (/r/FirefoxCSS)[https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS].
