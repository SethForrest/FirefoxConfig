- Place this file in your firefox profile folder, which can be found in your firefox menu: `Help > Troubleshooting Information > Profile Folder` then clicking `Open Folder`. 
- Place the `userChrome.css` file in the `chrome` folder in this directory. If the `chrome` folder does not exist, create it.
- In Firefox's `about:config` menu toggle `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.
