# FirefoxConfig
This is the `userChrome.css` file I use for Firefox. Place this file in your firefox profile folder, which can be found in your firefox menu: `Help > Troubleshooting Information > Profile Folder` then clicking `Open Folder`. 
Place the `userChrome.css` file in the `chrome` folder in this directory. If the `chrome` folder does not exist, create it.

This is designed around the wonderful [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) extension.  

It would not have been possible without much googling, and the help of the friendly people at [/r/FirefoxCSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS).


_Edit_: FF72 broke variable refrencing. (Updated: January, 2020)
